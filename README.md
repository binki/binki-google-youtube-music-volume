Adds quick volume set buttons for fixed volumes to YouTube Music.

The volume slider in YouTube Music is a continuous slider. The resolution with which the volume can be set is dependent on your screen and mouse resolution. It is hard to set the volume to the lowest audible volume quickly.

This script adds fixed volume buttons to jump the volume to 5%, 10%, 50%, or 100%.
